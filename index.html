        <p class="p-center">
          There is evidence of museums in the UK utilising a virtual space and
          online exhibits to maintain a reach during Covid 19, but I want to
          detach the exhibits from the physical museum such that the focus can
          be placed firmly on the exhibits themselves, while also allowing
          anyone from any walk of life with access to the web to learn something
          new even in a post Covid world.
          <br /><br />
          Museums are costly, they take up a huge amount of space and it is
          impractical to hold multiple large exhibits in one space - especially
          physically large exhibits or artifacts and ruins that are themselves
          unable to be transferred to a museum. A virtual web app would allow
          historians and museum specialists to not only portray (potentially 3D
          scanned) versions of the object in question, but also inform a more
          diverse audience about the history and culture surrounding the
          exhibit.
          <br /><br />
          My project would explore how an online web app might be designed, how
          3D exhibits and accompanying text could be uploaded and updated, with
          a potential database to hold said information such that exhibits could
          be quickly loaded back and forth.
