          There is evidence of museums in the UK utilising a virtual space and
          online exhibits to maintain a reach during Covid 19, but I want to
          detach the exhibits from the physical museum such that the focus can
          be placed firmly on the exhibits themselves, while also allowing
          anyone from any walk of life with access to the web to learn something
          new even in a post Covid world.
          <br /><br />
          Museums are costly, they take up a huge amount of space and it is
          impractical to hold multiple large exhibits in one space - especially
          physically large exhibits or artifacts and ruins that are themselves
          unable to be transferred to a museum. A virtual web app would allow
          historians and museum specialists to not only portray (potentially 3D
          scanned) versions of the object in question, but also inform a more
          diverse audience about the history and culture surrounding the
          exhibit.
          <br /><br />
          My project would explore how an online web app might be designed, how
          3D exhibits and accompanying text could be uploaded and updated, with
          a potential database to hold said information such that exhibits could
          be quickly loaded back and forth.

        <h2 class="topic-header">Week 1</h2>
        <p class="p-center">
          As alluded to in the previous entry, we had our first meeting with the
          client. This was our opportunity to lay out the main topics which
          would be required to set a full brief and begin working on the
          project. Though we had previously suggested using Zoom and meeting at
          midday, we ended up meeting half an hour earlier using Google.<br /><br />
          The meeting itself was quick and concise and both Kseniia and I were
          able to cover all the questions we had gathered. We learnt that the
          target audience would be a very broad range from toddlers to adults
          and is intended more so for those who wouldn't otherwise be going out
          and about.
          <br /><br />
          One thing we noted was just how open the project appeared to be; we
          were told that we are free to use more or less any mapping tool we
          want to for embedding purposes. What's more, the gamification aspects
          would require both a manual and automatic means of checking off
          locations. Automatic would be preferable and could potentially be
          linked to the QR codes, but manual would cover any potential errors or
          inconveniences.
          <br /><br />
          The prototype webapp will likely be lacking in content as we are
          reliant on the client to produce more content. We have an idea of what
          type of content will be used - audio guides for the entire route,
          drone footage, advised dress codes for the given route etc. But the
          client so far doesn't have a large stockpile of resources. This is
          manageable by using placeholders for the meantime.
          <br /><br />
          Lastly, following our concerns with the speed of email communication
          (or lack thereof), we asked the client if they would be happy to use
          slack. It turns out they already had a slack group for the project, so
          now we just have to wait to be invited.

        <p>
          This week we were invited to our client's Slack group and were
          provided some more information about the content requirements of the
          site. We were also provided a link to the client's original website
          and made note of a few questions that would need to be answered before
          the web-app is designed.<br /><br />
          Firstly, the client's original documentation made mention of an app -
          but we were under the impression that we would be designing and
          developing a web-app, so clarification would be needed on that front.
          Secondly, we would need clarification on where exactly the required
          content would be stored - on the web-app, completely separate to the
          original website, or the original website itself. Thus we are unsure
          exactly how the website and web-app will be connected and if the
          web-app will simply be part of the existing website.<br /><br />
          Due to these questions, we began writing up a project brief outlining
          the must haves and should haves, technical and design requirements,
          but need these few questions to be answered before we can finalize the
          brief.

          On Tuesday we spoke with Jack about what we needed to complete next
          and were given some advice:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Competitor reference can be used more as a starting point even
            without actual competitors<br />
          </li>
          <li>Go into the next meeting with a recommendation on features</li>
          <li>
            Set an agenda based on meeting notes and sum it up conversationally
            after
          </li>
          <li>Create a mood-board</li>
          <li>Come up with functionality</li>
        </ul>
        With this in mind we scheduled a meeting for Wednesday and met with the
        client. We discussed the few remaining questions we had and received
        adequate answers for all of them. This included confirmation that the
        app could be a webapp and where the webapp might eventually be located.
        The client also agreed with both our recommendations: a) content be
        stored in the webapp itself rather than the client's website and b) use
        a mini quiz as part of the collectables feature.

          We wrote up a brief summing up all the points that we had agreed on
          during our meetings and posted it in the Frome Valley slack group for
          approval. We had positive responses and only one discussion point
          about a timeframe. We explained that we would be presenting during
          January but that we did not yet have a set date for the final
          deliverable.

          User journey maps were developed for a series of potential users to
          understand how they might want to use a digital trails webapp, their
          expectations and emotions when using it.

          Work began on the creation of low-fi wireframes alongside discussions
          on how the gamification aspects would interact with the design.
          Challenges involved containing all the potential content within a
          relatively small mobile centric design.
